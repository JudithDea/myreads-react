# MyReads Project

For this project I used the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. I added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.
In the finished app you can find books (note: only certain key words are functional in the search, see below for more information) and put them on one of the three different shelves: Currently reading, want to read, read. To remove a book from your shelves select "none".

## TL;DR

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Search keywords

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Licensing

As mentioned, the starter code and the backend part were provided by Udacity.
Changes to this code were made according to the course content and the project rubric.
Thanks for reading!
